# Blitz3D TSS

This is a **fork** of [Blitz3D TSS](https://github.com/Saalvage/Blitz3D), made by [ZiYueCommentary](https://github.com/ZiYueCommentary/Blitz3D).

## Extending Blitz3D TSS
Please read [this document](EXTENDING.md).

## How to Build

### Prepare

- Visual Studio Community 2022
  - Desktop development with C++
  - C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
  - C++ ATL for latest v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
  - ASP.NET and web development

### Steps

1. Open `blitz3d.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Select Release or Debug config and rebuild the entire solution.
3. All done! You can find output files in the `_release` and `_release/bin` dirs. Feel free to delete `.pdb` and `.ilk` files here.

- **Note:** Blitz3D TSS uses the dynamic version of the fmod audio lib. 
  
  When redistributing programs built with Blitz3D TSS, you will need to also include the `fmod.dll` file found in the `bin` directory with your programs. 
  
  This should be placed in the same directory as your program's executable.
